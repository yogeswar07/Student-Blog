              <h3>written by saran</h3>
              <p>As a student doing their degree online, it can be challenging to make connections with people virtually. Socialising and networking are a couple of the most important aspects of your university life. Meeting new people is an incredible way to expand your circle and come across opportunities for your career.</p>
              <p>I consider myself to be a social person, I like to place myself in settings where I am around people to start meaningful conversations. Having distance as a barrier was a challenge I was willing to accept. I was not going to allow it to keep me from bonding with as many people as I wished.</p>

              <h2>Move over procrastination!</h2>
              <h3>written by simerpreet kaur singh</h3>
              <p>It is easy to give in to procrastination when there is a lot on your plate. Here is what I did to overcome procrastination and become more productive.</p>
              <p>
                I used to be a world class procrastinator. In fact, for the longest time, procrastinating was my forte. And no, it did not do me any good. In a time when remote working has become the norm, it is easy to sit back and think there is ample time to work and study and that‚Äôs when we lose track of time. That is exactly what happened to me. When exams got closer, I panicked because I couldn‚Äôt squeeze in enough study time to catch up with what I missed while I watched hundreds of documentaries and movies.

              <h2>Tips for exam preparation</h2>
              <h3>
                written by yogeswar reddy
              </h3>
              <p>In this blog, B.tech cse student yogeswar looks back on the December exam session and shares how she would prepare differently if she could turn back time.</p>
              <p>
                I would have followed my schedule more diligently. In fact, deviating from it was my biggest stress factor. It is worth remembering that making a commitment to ourselves carries as much weight as a commitment to others. 
I would have done things more intuitively. Sometimes, our very own trial-and-error process is the best path to diagnose and master shortcomings. All it takes is a little more trust in our own judgement on how to approach the task at hand, recognising that there is no magic formula to becoming the best students we can be. Most issues with how we approach our studies can be fixed, but we need to be able to identify them first. 
I would have listened to the online lectures more frequently. Not only are they a great source for supplementing our notes, but they also provide a framework of the most important concepts on each module topic. The more we listen to the lectures, the greater our understanding of those concepts would be. My programme provides me with the advantage of having all lectures recorded and available on demand for a long period of time. Many on-campus students only get to hear each lecture once. It is therefore wise to make better use of these resources. The lecture scripts are also a hidden gem. I grasped topics much faster by listening to the lectures while following and highlighting the script.

              <h2>Creativity in computing</h2>
              <p>No one likes buggy code, but what if not all bugs are bad? Kyle explores how being creative can be beneficial when coding.</p>
              <p>Semantic bugs are errors in programming that do not produce error messages or stop the code from running. Instead, they perform in a way that deviates from your expectations, causing unexpected behaviours. As tedious as these can be to debug, maybe not all of them have to be fixed. 

                Being creative is a beneficial skill in programming, as not all problems have a common answer. Obviously, doing something that no one has done before is great, but the true power of creativity is from the problem solving and not the final product. Not only is it fun to try something new and fresh, you will most likely encounter problems, errors and even new coding techniques you‚Äôve never used before; all of which makes you a better programmer even if your code becomes redundant or is not as cool as you thought it would be. 
                
                As my favourite game director Neil Druckmann said, and I‚Äôm paraphrasing here; ‚ÄúTake inspiration from other media, and not just from other video games.‚Äù If your only inspiration is video games, then you‚Äôll always make something that‚Äôs very similar to everything else out there. This can be broadly taken in any aspect of Computer Science.</p>

              <h2>
                How to succeed in an interview.
              </h2>
              <h4>
                written by simerpreet singh
              </h4>
              <p>
                Interviews are difficult. Worrying about how to get through them is normal, but I‚Äôm here give you a more positive perspective, and share with you some advice that can help you through your next interview!

Be optimistic

On your way to an interview, I would encourage you to be composed as you walk in. Imagine that you are the star, and you want to deliver a great performance that impresses everyone in the room. Staying optimistic can really help give a good first impression.

While on your journey, listen to light-hearted music, or any songs that put you in a good mood. Personally, I do this a lot, because music has this magical effect of transporting you to another place and letting you be happy, in the moment.

Another thing I always do is to search for some inspirational quotes. And here is one that I hope will inspire you:

‚ÄúThe will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential, these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.‚Äù

I strongly believe in the power these words carry. Quotes such as this can increase your motivation to excel, be it acing an interview or finally securing the position in your dream company.

Be your best self

Being your best self means both in appearance and in mind. Look yourself in the mirror for at least 15 seconds and tell yourself ‚ÄúYes, I am ready.‚Äù Cast out the worries of being rejected, or not getting the position you wanted. It‚Äôs OK ‚Äì just give it your best shot.

Another tip is to glance over the company‚Äôs dress code. This is highly dependent on company culture and the industry the company is in.

Practice, practice and practice!

Next is the most challenging part. It‚Äôs show time! ‚ÄúWhat am I going to say? How do I answer curveball questions?‚Äù

In all honesty, this requires substantial practice. With repetition, you can become more persuasive in your answers to these questions.

Seize the opportunity to get prepared for interviews, even if you may not be seriously looking for a job. Go to a class or a workshop, and reflect on the way you performed. This is also a good way for you to figure out your strengths and weaknesses, and realise what areas you should tackle on so as to improve yourself as a whole. The University of London provides extensive careers guidance, including around interviews. You can watch a recording of an informative webinar on this very subject, and many more careers-related topics, on the Careers section of the VLE.

As for the standard ‚ÄúWhat are your strengths and weaknesses?‚Äù question coming up, I usually use it as an opportunity to link back to the organisation and how I would be a good fit. For instance, if the organisation is very driven to contribute to charitable causes, and I have little experience in this area, I would say that the organisation is a great place for me to accumulate the experience and hone my skills in this area.

I hope that this advice is useful, and to fellow friends across the globe, I wish you all the best!

              <h2>Is Eminem the best rapper of all time?</h2>
              <p>The Beatles, Elvis, Michael Jackson, Eminem. There are only a few global superstars who reached the heights he has. Even mega-stars with millions upon millions of fans‚Äîlike Bono, Beyonc√©, Taylor Swift or Tupac‚Äîdidn‚Äôt or don‚Äôt reach the same magnitude of superstardom. Global, Superstars are like saints‚Äîthey generally need those three ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù. Phenomenons like The Beatles, Michael Jackson or Eminem change cultures, change music, and change history. The mega-superstars change more than just one thing, globally, and everything afterward is changed by them. There are superstars that change music, or change pop culture, or change the status quo. Then, there‚Äôs those ultra rare phenomena that change everything, and on a massive scale. These are the stats that have thousands of people crying and screaming and trampling each other to death just at the sight of them. They don‚Äôt just shut down traffic‚Äîpeople go to the hospital as barriers collapse and traffic is mowed over. It‚Äôs a phenomenon of fandom that has only happened for a rare few on a global scale. Imagine not being able to go to *any* country in the world without people running toward you trying to grab you. We have many superstars that get this kind of reaction at their concerts‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a rare few that get this reaction literally anywhere in the world.

                Michael Jackson was the King or Pop. From ballads to dance music to radio hits to holiday music, he could do it all and at the highest level. There was no competition for Michael. He was the King of Dance, and there wasn‚Äôt a soul alive that could compete. And he invented quite a bit, from the moonwalk to ‚Äúthe lean‚Äù. He was exceptionally business-savvy, too, and famously bought and owned The Beatles‚Äô catalog.
                With most rappers‚Äîand most singers‚Äîthey have a particular style, particular genre, and a particular ‚Äúpocket‚Äù niche of the kinds of songs they make. Take Metallica, for example. Metallica is a classic Metal band. They make metal. They don‚Äôt make country, or love ballads, or club music, or acapella singer-songwriter tunes. They have their one thing, and they‚Äôre one of the best of all time at that one thing.
                
                Practically any other rapper has a specific style, delivery, genre and niche. Jay-Z always sounds like Jay-Z. Nas always sounds like Nas. Those are superstars and indisputable fathers of rap, but even they don‚Äôt compare to Eminem. Eminem has that one style from the Slim Shady EP/LP that we all remember‚Äîand then he has at least dozen more. Any style, any delivery, any count at any tempo with any timing‚Äîhe does and has done it all. He‚Äôs created and continues to create styles no one has ever done before‚Ä¶.and has a range wider than anyone may ever have. He‚Äôs able to say anything, talk about any topic, and make any kind of song without it being dumb, ruining his ‚Äúimage‚Äù or limiting him into a niche. The fastest, the most complex, the most double and triple entandre, the most original songs, the most styles and methods, the largest vocabulary‚Äîthe list just keeps going on. You can argue that other rappers with extremely unique skills can compete at that one thing‚Äîbut not all of them. Joe Budden‚Äôs criticism is that he isn‚Äôt writing songs that will be played for decades anymore‚Äîthat Cleanin‚Äô our my Closet, Stan, Lose Yourself and Not Afraid were all ten years ago or longer. But if you think he won‚Äôt have at least one more ‚Äútimeless‚Äù song before he‚Äôs done, I‚Äôd take that bet. It‚Äôs the story telling, ironically, that launched Eminem into stardom. It was a combination of acting, script-writing, rap, singing and poetry that hardly anything can compare to. ‚ÄúIf I Had‚Äù and ‚ÄúKim‚Äù were gut-wrenching songs that instantly made anyone feel emerged in his story. Stan was a work of genius, and Cleanin‚Äô out my Closet (in my opinion, the best song he ever wrote) touched kids with crappy parents across the world.
                
                Who else could get away with singing a nursery rhyme and rapping in baby talk, making boy band pop-ballad satire, hard core gangster rap, songs about killing cheating spouses, trash-talking themselves‚Äîlet alone use words like ‚Äúpout‚Äù, ‚Äúboo boo‚Äù or any of the other various craziness that‚Äôs come out of his mouth and be taken seriously? Maybe one of those things, but no one but him has the ability to cover anything in any way. There used to be a niche‚Äîa limitation to what rap was, and what you could get away with saying and still be taken seriously. He changed that. Now, you‚Äôll hear rappers intentionally sounding like a white wannabe rapper from Malibu‚Äôs Most Wanted. On purpose. Now, you‚Äôll hear rappers intentionally drop words they could never have said in the 90‚Äôs. There was a time when all rap was in a niche, and limited to cool, tough bad-asses from the streets. Eminem changed that. It wasn‚Äôt cool to talk about being broke. It wasn‚Äôt cool to talk about not having food. There was an image with rap, and if you didn‚Äôt fit that image you didn‚Äôt belong. He opened a door to humility, and an intimacy that rap never had before. It wasn‚Äôt just his technical ability, it was exposing his personal life and every flaw, every failing and every ‚Äúweakness‚Äù.
                
                Eminem is the best-selling hip hop artist of all time, with 170+ million albums sold worldwide. Indisputably, no one compares to his sales. He has dominated charts for three decades, and shows no sign of stopping. At his peak in 2002, he famously said he could sell a blank CD. And he could have.
                
                ‚ÄúBest rapper‚Äù is an opinion. But you can measure him by any standard and he‚Äôll come out at the top. Are there more popular rappers in 2018? Sure. Are new artists with new talents we‚Äôve never heard before more exciting than an artist you‚Äôve heard from for decades? No doubt. But ‚Äúbest‚Äù in those cases probably just means you‚Äôre excited because it‚Äôs new.
